# Concentration game

The repository is an archive of a school project to implement a simple concentration game (memorama in Spanish) in Python 3. As such many comments and propmts are in Spanish.


## reto.py
This file corresponds to the terminal only implementation of the game, and was used as an example for tutoring other students in the basics of programming in Python.


## memorama.py
This file corresponds to the GUI implementation, using the PyGObject library and GTK3.

**Note:** Currently the original Glade GUI file is missing, ergo the program will fail. However, this file was very simple, and a replacement could be made very easily.
